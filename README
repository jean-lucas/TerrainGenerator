## Terrain Generator ##


Upon running the program:
 i) First insert size of terrain (50 - 300)
 ii) Specify which height generation algorithm to use:
 		0 : circle algorithm (looks best if used for large terrain sizes)
 		1 : fault algorithm  (looks best if used for small terrain sizes)


Extra features implemented:
1. 2D representation of the map, but did not use a grayscale, rather I used a different color scale (extra feature #3)
2. Implemented an addition height generation algorithm using the fault algorithm (extra feature #2)
3. Improved map colouring (ONLY WORKS WHEN LIGHT MODE IS TOGGLED OFF) (extra feature #7)


Commands:
	
	'Q'  -   Quit program
	'L'  -	 Toggle Lights on/off
	'M'  -   Turn ON material mode

	'C'  -   Move Light #1 to the left
	'V'  -   Move Light #1 to the right
	'D'  -   Move Light #1 up
	'F'  - 	 Move Light #1 down

	For light #2 movement use the same keys C,V,D,F but hold the ALT key

	'W'  - 	 Alternate between solid shape, or wireframe
	'T'  -   Toggle between QUADS or TRIANGLE primitives (must be in wireframe mode to see the difference)

	'-'  -   Zoom out
	'+'  -   Zoom in

	'R'  -   Resets a new random board (slow with large sizes :[ )
